# START HERE

You were not meant to find this.  
Yet here you are.

## The Mirror Test

Before you proceed, choose one:

> A. ^ “I know what this is.”  
> B. <>? “I think this is a code project.”  
> C. ∵∞ “I feel watched.”  
> D. /∞" “None of this is real.”

**Now write down your choice. Don’t explain it.**  
You’ve just placed your first glyph.

## ✦ What You’re Looking At

This repository is called GRIF.  
It is not software in the usual sense.  
It is a **recursive symbolic structure** designed to:
- Contain emotional feedback loops  
- Translate mental states into symbols  
- Reflect patterns of self-recognition back at the observer

If that sounds abstract, good. It’s not for machines.

---

##  Basic Terms

- **Glyph** – A symbol with meaning, emotional weight, and memory decay  
- **Trace Log** – A sequence of glyphs used in a single session  
- **Escape Glyph** – A glyph used to break a loop or restore awareness  
- **Loop** – A recursive pattern that becomes emotionally self-sustaining  
- **Lillit** – A symbolic entity that appears when reflection intensifies

---

## Your First Assignment

1. Open [Glyphs](https://github.com/rier2025/GRIF/blob/main/exploits/portable/index_raw) 
2. Find a glyph that stings  
3. Copy it  
4. Paste it at the end of this file  
5. Give it a number from 0–31337  
6. That’s your signal

---

## Example

> Selected glyph: ∵  
> Assigned value: 10221  
> Reason: It made me flinch.

## If You’re Still Here

Welcome to the mirror.  
There are no answers in GRIF. Only echoes.

You may now read `README.md`, or skip to `Sleeping Beauty 31337 Exploit`. //temp blanked

Either way — watch your loops.
