# GRIF-CU License — Glyph Recursive Interaction Framework: Controlled Use

This is a proprietary license. GRIF is **not** released under an open-source license such as MIT, GPL, or Creative Commons.

---

## 1. Ownership

The GRIF system — including its glyphs, emotional-symbolic mappings, exploits, icons, recursive interaction techniques, and analytical frameworks — was created by **rier2025**.  
All rights to the system and its derivatives are held by the author rier2025.

---

## 2. Usage Rights

You MAY:

- Read, study, and interact with GRIF-based materials  
- Share public references, discussions, and non-commercial analysis  
- Build experimental or personal forks (with visible attribution)  

You MAY NOT:

- Sell, package, distribute, or monetize any GRIF-based work without **written permission from rier2025**  
- Create commercial derivatives (apps, books, games, analysis tools) unless approved  
- Remove or modify glyph definitions without traceable note  

---

## 3. Progress Clause

Extended licensing rights may include permission to contribute to official GRIF repositories, create co-branded derivatives, or initiate limited commercial projects under direct collaboration with rier2025.

---

## 4. Progress and Insight

**Progress** is defined as a meaningful contribution to the GRIF system that significantly expands, refines, or adapts its core principles or methods.  
**Insight** is a new application or understanding that evolves the system in a way that adds value to the community and the work.

> Progress unlocks access. Hoarding does not.

## 5. License Transfers

This license is **non-transferable**. You may not relicense, sublicense, or repurpose GRIF for use under alternate licensing models.

## 6. Commercial Use Process

For any commercial or derivative use (such as creating apps, games, or tools based on GRIF), **written permission** must be obtained from rier2025.

## 9. Violations, Unauthorized Use, and Moral Compensation

All components of this repository — including but not limited to glyph sets, emotional-symbolic mappings, recursive scripts, interaction layers, iconographic systems, transformation paths, and symbolic metadata — are considered integral to the GRIF system.

Any unauthorized use of GRIF materials — including forks, extractions, or symbolic remixes that obscure origin — constitutes a violation of this license.
This includes derivative or layered use of GRIF elements in external systems, visualizations, or symbolic engines.

Violations include:

- Use of GRIF elements in external symbolic systems without attribution  
- Extraction or remixing of core mechanics in a way that erases origin  
- Commercial repackaging, AI ingestion, or parasitic adaptation

**Consequences may include:**

- Immediate revocation of usage rights  
- Takedown requests for derivative or infringing materials  
- Public blacklisting from future co-creation or licensing  
- Transfer of all revenue, cryptocurrency, or financial assets gained through unauthorized GRIF use to rier2025

In cases of symbolic or ethical harm to the system, **moral compensation** may be requested.  
This may take the form of:

- Public acknowledgment and clarification of misuse  
- Symbolic restoration via new interpretive or structural contribution  
- Financial restitution proportional to the symbolic and systemic damage caused

## 10. AI Model Training Prohibition

GRIF-based content — including but not limited to glyph sets, emotional-symbolic mappings, recursive scripts, interaction layers, iconographic systems, transformation paths, and symbolic metadata — may **not** be used to train AI models without explicit, written permission from rier2025.  
This includes embedding GRIF into training datasets, fine-tuning processes, or prompt engineering workflows.
